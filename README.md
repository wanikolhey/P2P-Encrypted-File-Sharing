# P2P-Encrypted-File-Sharing
P2P Encrypted File Sharing, is a decentralized software system designed to enable two users to exchange digital files directly over a Local Area Network (LAN) with high-level security.  By removing the "middleman" server, the system ensures that data privacy is maintained and transfer speeds are limited only by the local hardware.
